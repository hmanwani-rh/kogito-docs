using the Quarkus CLI. Prerequisites Ensure that the required dependencies are installed. Your Serverless Workflow application is ready to be built. For more information about creating your Serverless Workflow application, see Creating your first Serverless Workflow service. Quarkus CLI 2.10.2.Final is installed. Java 11+ is installed. Apache Maven 3.8.1 or later is installed. Latest version of Docker is installed. Alternatively, you can use Jib to build container images. However, Docker is required to build GraalVM native image using the Quarkus native builder image. Optionally, GraalVM 22.0.0.2 is installed. Quarkus provides a few extensions to build container images, such as Jib, docker, s2i, and buildpacks. For more information about the Quarkus extensions, see the Quarkus documentation. The examples in this document assume that you have the Quarkus tooling installed. For more information about the tooling, see Using Serverless Workflow tooling. To get started with building Serverless Workflow images, you can use the serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus example application. Prerequisites Quarkus 2.10.2.Final is installed. You can skip the following procedure, if you already have a Serverless Workflow application. Procedure Clone the kogito-examples repository and navigate to the serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus example application. Clone an example application git clone --branch main https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples.git && cd kogito-examples/serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus To run the example application, follow the instructions in Creating your first Serverless Workflow service. Install the Quarkus command line interface (CLI). For more information, see Installing the Quarkus CLI. Add the required Quarkus extension using Quarkus CLI: Add the Jib extension quarkus extension add 'container-image-jib' After adding the Jib extension, if you see the pom.xml file, you can verify the newly added dependency: Verify the Jib extension io.quarkus quarkus-container-image-jib After installing the required tooling, you can start building your Serverless Workflow application. Prerequisites You have created a Quarkus project. Quarkus CLI is installed. For more information about installing the Quarkus CLI, see Installing the Quarkus CLI. Procedure In a command terminal, navigate to your Quarkus project. To build your Serverless Workflow application on Quarkus, run the following command: Build your Serverless Workflow application quarkus build -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=kogito \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0 \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io The added Jib extension caches the target/lib directory. Based on the size of your project, Jib speeds up the rebuilds. If you want to push your Serverless Workflow application to a registry, ensure that you define the following properties as required: quarkus.container-image.registry: To define the registry address, such as quay.io. quarkus.container-image.group: To define the registry. For example, context/namespace or in case of Kubernetes or OpenShift namespace/project. quarkus.container-image.push: To define whether or not to push an image. Set the value of this property to true. By default, this property is set as false. Example of pushing the built Serverless Workflow application to a registry quarkus build -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=kogito \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0 \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.push=true The previous command results in the following container image: quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0 Alternatively, you can create an Apache Maven profile to build the container image, which can be triggered by setting the target profile. Example Apache Maven profile build-container true kogito serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus 1.0 quay.io true You can activate the created Apache Maven profile using Quarkus CLI: Activate the Apache Maven profile quarkus build -- -Pbuild-container When it comes to Serverless Workflow, a small startup footprint is expected, which can be better when using the native builds to build a Serverless Workflow application. Prerequisites You have created a Quarkus project. Quarkus CLI is installed. For more information about installing the Quarkus CLI, see Installing the Quarkus CLI. Procedure In a command terminal, navigate to your Quarkus project. To build a native image, pass the --native flag using Quarkus CLI: Example of building a native image quarkus build --native -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.group=kogito \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.name=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.tag=1.0-native \\ -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=quay.io The previous command results in the following container image: quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0-native In case GraalVM is not installed, you can set the quarkus.native.container-build=true system property, which creates a Linux executable. Configure Docker to use the in-cluster (Remote) Docker daemon When build Container Images using a remote Docker Daemon, i.e. Minikube, you need to use the following system property instead of -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true -Dquarkus.native.remote-container-build=true When you build Container Images using a remote Docker Daemon, such as Minikube, then use the following system property instead of -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true property: System property to use a remote Docker Daemon -Dquarkus.native.remote-container-build=true For more information about native builds, see Building a native executable. After building your Serveless Workflow image using Quarkus CLI, you can test the built image. Prerequisites Latest version of Docker is installed. Procedure Start JVM and native Container Images. Example JVM image Example native image docker run -it -p 8080:8080 quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0 ... INFO [io.quarkus] (main) serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus 1.22.1.Final on JVM (powered by Quarkus 2.9.2.Final) started in 1.302s docker run -it -p 8080:8080 quay.io/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0-native ... INFO [io.quarkus] (main) serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus 1.22.1.Final native (powered by Quarkus 2.9.2.Final) started in 0.039s Note that the startup of native image is faster than the JVM image. To invoke the Serverless Workflow application, execute the following command once the container is started: Example request Example response curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' -d '{\"workflowdata\" : {\"name\": \"John\", \"language\": \"English\"}}' http://localhost:8080/jsongreet { \"id\": \"2acf710d-7e4a-481d-925c-dfd85a369987\", \"workflowdata\": { \"name\": \"John\", \"language\": \"English\", \"greeting\": \"Hello from JSON Workflow, \" } } Deploying your Serverless Workflow application on Minikube Deploying your Serverless Workflow application on Kubernetes If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.

You can check the Minikube installation by entering the following commands in a command terminal: Verify Minikube version minikube version Verify Knative CLI version kn version Verify kubectl CLI version kubectl version If kubectl is not installed, then Minikube handles it when you execute the following command: kubectl is available using Minikube alias kubectl=\"minikube kubectl --\" Once you verify the Minikube and Knative CLI installation, you can install Knative on Minikube. Prerequisites Minikube is installed. Knative CLI is installed. For more information, see Install the Knative CLI. Procedure Open a command terminal and install Knative on Minikube. Configure Knative on Minikube. Knative CLI offers quickstart plug-in, which provides the required configurations. For information about installing the quickstart plug-in, see Install Knative using quickstart. After configuring the plug-in, execute the following command to configure a Minikube profile: Configure a Minikube profile kn quickstart minikube The previous command configures a Minikube profile called knative. After creating a Minikube profile, all Minikube commands use the created profile. To list the available Minikube profiles, enter the following command: List the available Minikube profiles minikube profile list Enter the following command to open the Minikube web console on the knative profile: Open Minikube web console minikube dashboard --profile knative The previous command opens the Kubernetes Management console in your browser. If the console is not opened, you can go to the URL that is returned. To follow the manual process of installing Knative on Minikube, see Knative tutorial on Minikube. Once you install Knative on Minikube, you can initiate the process of deploying your Serverless Workflow application on Minikube. Prerequisites Minikube is installed. Knative CLI is installed. For more information, see Installing Knative on Minikube. (Optional) Quarkus CLI is installed. For more information, see Building Quarkus Apps with Quarkus command line interface (CLI). Serverless Workflow application container is ready. Procedure In a command terminal, enter the following command to configure Docker to use the in-cluster Docker daemon: Configure Docker to use in-cluster Docker Daemon eval $(minikube -p minikube docker-env --profile knative When using Minikube, you can share your local registry with the Docker Daemon. If your Serverless Workflow application container image was built before configuring Docker, then you might need to build the image again so that the image is available on the Minikube Docker. Ensure that you use the following system property when building native container images that use Minikube Docker Daemon: System property to build container images -Dquarkus.native.remote-container-build=true Use the -Dquarkus.container-image.registry=some_of_the_values_above property to enable Knative fetch the container images from Minikube Docker Daemon. You might be required to tag the container images using one of the following registry options: ko.local dev.local You might need to set the imagePullPolicy to Never or IfNotPresent, otherwise Minikube pulls the images from a remote registry. This behavior can be avoided by tagging the image using previously listed domains. For more information, see How to use locally built docker image. To prepare the environment, start the Minikube tunnel using Knative profile: Start Minikube tunnel using Knative profile minikube tunnel --profile knative The previous command starts in a loop. Therefore, this command must be running throughout the process mentioned in this document. On Mac and Windows, you might be required to provide the user password. Example tunnel output Status: machine: knative pid: 124859 route: 10.96.0.0/12 -> 192.168.58.2 minikube: Running services: [kourier] errors: minikube: no errors router: no errors loadbalancer emulator: no errors After starting the Minikube tunnel, create serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus namespace using the following command: Create namespace kubectl create namespace serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus Set the context to the newly created namespace using the following command: Set context to a namespace kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus After setting the context, all Minikube commands use the created namespace. You can use the following command to verify the current namespace: Verify the current namespace kubectl config view --minify -o jsonpath='{..namespace}' Install your Serverless Workflow application using the container image. You can use the native image due to the faster startup. For more information about installing the Serverless Workflow application, see Building Serverless Workflow Images using Quarkus CLI document. In the following procedures, you can find two examples of deploying your Serverless Workflow application, including: Using Knative CLI (kn) Using kubectl command-line tool Once you install your Serverless Workflow application using the container image, you can use the command-line tools, such as Knative CLI or kubectl to initiate the deployment process. Prerequisites Serverless Workflow application is installed. Knative CLI is installed. For more information, see Install the Knative CLI. Procedure In a command terminal, execute to following command to deploy your Serverless Workflow application using Knative CLI: Example of deploying Serverless Workflow application using Knative CLI kn service create hello \\ --image=dev.local/kogito/serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus:1.0-native \\ --pull-policy=IfNotPresent \\ --port 8080 Example output Creating service 'hello' in namespace 'serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus': 0.066s The Route is still working to reflect the latest desired specification. 0.099s ... 0.322s Configuration \"hello\" is waiting for a Revision to become ready. 4.885s ... 5.061s Ingress has not yet been reconciled. 5.322s Waiting for load balancer to be ready 5.460s Ready to serve.

Prerequisites Serverless Workflow application is installed. kubectl command-line tool is installed. Procedure To deploy your Serverless Workflow application, you can use plain Kubernetes objects. Therefore, instead of creating knative, yaml|json descriptors, you can leverage the Quarkus Kubernetes extension and Kogito Knative add-on to generate the descriptors. To use the Quarkus Kubernetes extension and Kogito Knative add-on, ensure that the following dependencies are available in pom.xml file and Gradle: pom.xml Gradle org.kie.kogito kogito-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing io.quarkus quarkus-kubernetes quarkus-kubernetes 'io.quarkus:quarkus-kubernetes:2.10.2.Final' quarkus-kubernetes 'org.kie.kogito:kogito-addons-quarkus-knative-eventing:main' To generate the knative, yaml|json descriptors, set the following system properties with -D prefix (if using Quarkus CLI) in the application.properties file of your Serverless Workflow application: System properties to generate descriptors quarkus.kubernetes.deployment-target=knative quarkus.knative.name=greeting-quarkus-kubectl Build your Serverless Workflow application.

Kogito supports the java and sysout custom types. The CNCF specification does not support java and sysout functions. Therefore, these functions might not be portable across other implementations. You can use the sysout function for debugging or for quick demonstrations as shown in the following example: Example of sysout function definition { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"printMessage\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"sysout\" } ] } In the state definition, you can call the same sysout function as shown in the following example: Example of a sysout function reference within a state { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"myState\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"printAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"printMessage\", \"arguments\": { \"message\": \".\" } } } ] } ] } You must avoid using the sysout function in a production environment since it can spam the unnecessary data in the application log. Kogito supports the java functions within an Apache Maven project, in which you define your Serverless Workflow service. The following example shows the declaration of a java function: Example of a java function declaration { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"myFunction\", (1) \"type\": \"custom\", (2) \"operation\": \"service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod\" (3) } ] } 1 myFunction is the function name 2 custom is the function type 3 service:java:com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass::myMethod is the Kogito custom operation definition. In the custom operation definition, service is the reserved operation keyword followed by the java keyword. com.acme.MyInterfaceOrClass is the FQCN (Fully Qualified Class Name) of the interface or implementation class followed by the method name (myMethod). Your method interface must receive a Jackson’s JsonNode object and return either void or another JsonNode as shown in the following example: Example of a java function implementation public class MyInterfaceOrClass { public void myMethod(JsonNode workflowData) { // do whatever I want with the JsonNode: // { \"workflowdata\": {} } } public JsonNode myMethod(JsonNode workflowData) { // do whatever I want with the JsonNode: // { \"workflowdata\": {} } // return the modified content: return workflowData; } } To call the function shown in the previous example within your Serverless Workflow service, you can extract the required JSON value using jq expression or pass the JSON value without using arguments. In the following example, the caller sends the entire payload: Example of a java function reference within a state { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"myState\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"callJavaFunctionAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myFunction\" } } ] } ] } Alternatively, you can pass the necessary data as shown in the following example: Example of a java function reference within a state passing the necessary data { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"myState\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"callJavaFunctionAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"myFunction\", \"arguments\": { \"data\": \"${ .my.expression.to.data }\" } } } ] } ] } In the previous example, the JsonNode that the java function returns is the new payload in the Serverless Workflow execution.

A data model consists of a JSON object regardless of whether the workflow file contains YAML or JSON. The initial content of the JSON object depends on how the workflow is started. If the workflow is created using Cloud Event, then the workflow content is taken from the data property. However, if the workflow is started through an HTTP POST invocation, then the workflow content is taken from the workflowdata property. The workflow expressions in the Serverless Workflow Specification are used to interact with the data model. The supported expression languages include JsonPath and jq. jq expression language is the default language. However, you can change the expression language to JsonPath using the expressionLang property. This document describes the usage of jq expressions in switch state conditions, action function arguments, and data filtering. The conditions occurring in a switch state enable the workflow designer to select the path that workflow follows based on the data model content. A condition in a switch state is an expression, which returns a boolean value when evaluated against the data model. If a condition associated with a state transition returns true, then the workflow must follow that transition. For example, in the serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus example application, a message is displayed depending on the selected language, that is English or Spanish. If the value of the language property is English, the constant literal injected on the message property is Hello from, otherwise the constant value injected on the message property is Saludos desde…. The switch state in the serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus example application contains the following conditions, which in turn contains two jq expressions returning a boolean. Example conditions in serverless-workflow-greeting-quarkus \"dataConditions\": [ { \"condition\": \"${ .language == \\\"English\\\" }\", \"transition\": \"GreetInEnglish\" }, { \"condition\": \"${ .language == \\\"Spanish\\\" }\", \"transition\": \"GreetInSpanish\" } ] The Serverless Workflow Specification requires all the expressions to be embedded within ${… }. However, Kogito Serverless Workflow figures out whether or not a string is an expression. Therefore, you can save characters and skip ${ in the beginning and } in the end. In case of portablity, you must embed the expressions within ${… }. In the Serverless Workflow Specification, you can define workflow functions, which can be invoked several times by the workflow states. Each workflow function call might contain different arguments, which are specified using the function arguments. For example, you can see the temperature conversion function definition in serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application. The temperature conversion function performs OpenAPI invocations to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius. For more information about OpenAPI, see Orchestrating the OpenAPI services. Following is the subtraction function in serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application: Example subtraction function in serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"subtraction\", \"operation\": \"specs/subtraction.yaml#doOperation\" }] The arguments in subtraction function are expressed as a JSON object, and the property values of the JSON object are either a string containing an expression or a JSON data type, such as string, number, or boolean. Example arguments in subtraction function \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"subtraction\", \"arguments\": { \"leftElement\": \".fahrenheit\", \"rightElement\": \".subtractValue\" } } In the previous example, the left number is equal to the fahrenheit property (an input number that invokes the workflow), and the right number is equal to the substractvalue property (a constant number that is injected to the workflow model by SetConstants state). Once the expression evaluation is resolved for all properties that contain an expression, the resulting object is passed in the OpenAPI request. Based on the OpenAPI definition, the properties in the JSON object are used as body, path, query, or header of the upcoming REST invocation. Following is an example of function arguments defined as string that contains an expression, returning a JSON object: Example function arguments defined as string \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"subtraction\", \"arguments\": \"{leftElement: .fahrenheit, rightElement : .subtractValue}\" } In the previous example, the result of the expression evaluation is the same JSON object than in the first case, which is passed as arguments of the OpenAPI request. The Serverless workflow Specification defines the following filtering mechanisms to select which information should be part of the workflow data model: Action data filters: Select the part of the action result that is merged into the data model, which overrides the properties that share the name with the selected action result. Event data filters: Similar to the action data filters, but apply to the events instead of actions. State data filters: Define the workflow model to the JSON object, which is returned by the expression and discards an existing property. For example, you can see serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus, in which actions and state data filters are used. Following is an expression function in serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus example application: Example expression function in serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"max\", \"type\": \"expression\", \"operation\": \"{max: .numbers | max_by(.x), min: .numbers | min_by(.y)}\" } ] In the previous example, an array of complex numbers (x is real coordinate and y is imaginary coordinate) is accepted and an expression function is defined to calculate the maximum value of x and minimum value of y for the numbers array. Also, the serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus example application contains an action data filter defined inside squareState action and a state data filter defined inside finish state. The action data filter selects the maximum value of x to be merged to the workflow model, and the state data filter defines the maximum value as the entire workflow model that is returned as the workflow response. The previous example expression also contains a max function of type expression and an operation property containing a string of jq expression. This jq expression returns a JSON object, in which the max property is the maximum value of the x coordinate and the min property is the minimum value of the y coordinate. Following is an action data filter in serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus example application: Example action data filter in serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"maxAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"max\" }, \"actionDataFilter\": { \"results\" : \".max.x\", \"toStateData\" : \".number\" } } ] In case the previous example of action data filter is not added in the serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus, then the entire JSON object returned by the function is merged into the workflow model. The previous action data filter contains the following properties: results, selecting the attribute from the data returned by the action. toStateData, indicating the name of the target property inside the workflow model. If the target property does not exist, then a target property is added. Therefore, after executing the action, the workflow model consists of a number property, containing the maximum value of x and the original numbers array. After that, the workflow transitions to the finish state. Example state data filter in serverless-workflow-expression-quarkus \"name\": \"finish\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"stateDataFilter\": { \"input\": \"{result: .number}\" } The original numbers array should not be returned as a result of the workflow execution, therefore the final stage consists of a state data filter defining the content of the output model. The output model should contain a result property and the value of result property should be the maximum number that is stored by the previous state in the number property. In the previous example, the workflow model is changed by the input property of the filter, which means that the output model is updated before the state is executed. As a final result, the output model consists of a result property, containing the maximum value of x.

The Serverless Workflow specification provides an error handling mechanism, enabling you to handle the errors that might happen during the interactions between the workflow and external systems. When an error occurs, it changes the regular Serverless Workflow sequence. In such cases, a workflow state transitions to an alternative state that can potentially handle the error, instead of transitioning to the predefined state. Note that error definition for a Serverless Workflow is optional. If error handling is not defined, then the workflow execution is aborted when an error occurs. As a developer, you can consider the error handling in Serverless Workflow as a try-catch or a goto construct. An error definition in Serverless Workflow is composed of a name and code parameters. The name is a short and natural language description of an error, such as wrong parameter. The code parameter helps the implementation to identify the error. In Kogito, the code parameter is mandatory, which consists of the fully qualified Java class name of an exception type. To determine if an exception is handled by an error definition, Kogito first checks whether or not the type of the Java exception is an instance of the exception that is specified in the error definition. Otherwise, Kogito recursively applies the same check to any embedded exception within the original Java one, till the exception chain is exhausted. The workflow in the serverless-workflow-error-quarkus example application illustrate the usage of the error handling mechanism. Figure 1. Example of error handling The workflow accepts an integer number as the input model. When the workflow starts, it invokes the isEven Java service, which accepts that integer number as a parameter. This service throws an IllegalArgumentException exception if the integer number is odd. This means that if the integer number is even, the Serverless Workflow transitions to the even state, however, if the integer number is odd, the Serverless Workflow transitions to the odd state, resulting in a different model output. Example checkEven state { \"name\": \"checkEven\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"checkEvenAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"isEven\", \"arguments\": { \"number\": \"$.number\" } } } ], \"transition\": \"even\", \"onErrors\": [ { \"errorRef\": \"odd number\", \"transition\": \"odd\" } ] } The workflow defines a function that invokes the isEven method of org.kie.kogito.examples.EvenService class. This function uses a custom function type, enabling Kogito to invoke Java methods. Example isEven function definition { \"name\": \"isEven\", \"type\": \"custom\", \"operation\": \"service:java:org.kie.kogito.examples.EvenService::isEven\" } To handle the error, the worflow defines an odd number error which handles any runtime exception. As the IllegalArgumentException is a child of RuntimeException, if isEven method throws the exception, it will be handled. Example error definition \"errors\": [ { \"name\": \"odd number\", \"code\": \"java.lang.RuntimeException\" } ] The Inject state is used to populate the model with specific JSON payload. Therefore, the even and odd state defines the message property as even and odd respectively. { \"name\": \"even\", \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"numberType\": \"even\" }, \"transition\": \"finish\" }, { \"name\": \"odd\", \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"numberType\": \"odd\" }, \"transition\": \"finish\" } The finish state in the serverless-workflow-error-quarkus example application displays the model content to the console, so you can verify that the expected message has been set. { \"name\": \"finish\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"printAction\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"printMessage\", \"arguments\": { \"message\": \"$.numberType\" } } } ], \"end\": { \"terminate\": \"true\" } } Creating your first Serverless Workflow service If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.

Kogito supports events of the workflow model as defined in the Serverless Workflow specification definition, except the following: resultEventRef property in EventRefDefintion is not implemented and, if specified, this property is ignored. Same functionality can be achieved by using Callback state. Correlation has limited support. see Event correlation with Serverless Workflows. Kogito supports the implementation of the data manipulation feature using jq (default) or jsonpath expressions. jsonpath expressions can have limitations in specific scenarios of complex data manipulation. For more information, see Workflow Data section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation. Kogito also supports data filtering. For more information about the data filtering, see State data filters section in the Serverless Workflow specification documentation. Kogito supports jq or jsonpath to define the Serverless Workflow expressions. jq is the default expression language, however, if you want to use jsonpath, set the expressionLang attribute in the workflow definition as shown in the following example: Example of changing the default expression language { \"id\": \"myworkflow\", \"version\": \"1.0\", \"expressionLang\": \"jsonpath\", \"name\": \"Workflow example\", \"description\": \"An example of how to use jsonpath expressions\" } jsonpath expression is not recommended because of the limitations of the language for data manipulation. Instead, you can use jq in various use cases. Kogito supports the error handling feature as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. For more information about error handling, see Serverless Workflow Error Handling. Kogito does not support Retries feature, however, it will be implemented in a future release. Alternatively, you can use Serverless Workflow Error Handling. Kogito does not support Timeouts feature, however, it will be implemented in a future release. Kogito supports workflow compensation as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. For more information about compensations, see Orchestration-based SAGA pattern. Kogito supports workflow constants as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. Kogito supports workflow secrets as described in the Serverless Workflow specification definition. Secrets are associated with the Quarkus Configuration module. This means that any form of configuration that Quarkus supports is also supported in Kogito.

This guide describes how to create a Serverless Workflow application that serves a hello_world endpoint. The workflow contains the following two states: Inject Hello World: Injects a Hello World message into the response Inject Mantra: Injects a Mantra message into the response Figure 1. Example Hello World workflow Prerequisites Java 11+ is installed with JAVA_HOME configured appropriately. Maven 3.8.1 Quarkus CLI 2.10.2.Final or Knative CLI 0.0.0 Visual Studio Code with Red Hat Java Extension and Red Hat Serverless Workflow Editor is installed to edit your workflows. For more information about the tooling and the required dependencies, see tooling guide. To create your Serverless Workflow service, first you need to bootstrap a project. Procedure In a command terminal, use one of the below mentioned command to create a project: Quarkus CLI Maven Knative CLI Create a project using Quarkus CLI quarkus create app \\ -x=kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow \\ -x=quarkus-container-image-jib \\ -x=quarkus-resteasy-jackson \\ -x=quarkus-smallrye-openapi \\ org.kie.kogito.examples:serverless-workflow-hello-world:1.0 The previous command creates a Maven Quarkus project in the serverless-workflow-hello-world directory containing the required Kogito dependencies, including: kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow: Adds support for Serverless Workflow quarkus-container-image-jib: Adds support for Container Image Builds quarkus-resteasy-jackson: Adds support for RESTEasy, which is required by the generated REST resources that are used to start the flow process using an HTTP request quarkus-smallrye-openapi: Adds support for Swagger documentation when you run the application in development mode The SwaggerUI is available at http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui/ when you run the application. Create a project using Maven mvn io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-maven-plugin:2.10.2.Final:create \\ -DprojectGroupId=org.kie.kogito.examples \\ -DprojectArtifactId=serverless-workflow-hello-world \\ -Dextensions=\"kogito-quarkus-serverless-workflow,quarkus-container-image-jib,quarkus-resteasy-jackson,quarkus-smallrye-openapi\" cd serverless-workflow-hello-world In the previous command, org.kie.kogito.examples, serverless-workflow-hello-world, and 1.0 is group id, artifact id, and version of your project respectively. Create a project using Knative CLI kn workflow create --name my-project --extension quarkus-jsonp,quarkus-smallrye-openapi Follow this guide to know more information on Knative CLI. To verify that project is created, compile the project using the following command: Quarkus CLI Maven Knative CLI Compile your project using Quarkus CLI quarkus build Compile your project using Maven mvn clean package Builds the project and generates a local image called \"quay.io/other-user/my-project:1.0.1\" kn workflow build --image my-user/my-project:1.0.0 --image-repository other-user --image-tag 1.0.1 Follow this guide to know more information on Knative CLI. After bootstrapping a project, you need to create a workflow. In the following procedure, a workflow named Hello World Workflow is created. Procedure Create a file named hello.sw.json in the src/main/resources directory with the following content: Example content for hello.sw.json file { \"id\": \"hello_world\", (1) \"version\": \"1.0\", \"specVersion\": \"0.8\", \"name\": \"Hello World Workflow\", \"description\": \"JSON based hello world workflow\", \"start\": \"Inject Hello World\", (3) \"states\": [ (2) { \"name\": \"Inject Hello World\", \"type\": \"inject\", (4) \"data\": { (5) \"greeting\": \"Hello World\" }, \"transition\": \"Inject Mantra\" (6) }, { \"name\": \"Inject Mantra\", \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"mantra\": \"Serverless Workflow is awesome!\" (7) }, \"end\": true (8) } ] } In the previous example: 1 id field is the unique identifier of the workflow. Kogito generates the REST endpoints based on this unique identifier. 2 states defines the states of the workflow. In the Hello World example, the workflow contains two states, such as Inject Hello World and Inject Mantra. 3 start field defines the state in which the workflow starts. 4 type defines the type of the state. In the previous example, the state is inject. The inject state can be used to inject static data into state data input. 5 data defines the data that is injected into the state. In the previous example, greeting is injected with the Hello World value. 6 transition field defines the next state that will be reached after the current state is completed. 7 Injects a mantra with the value Serverless Workflow is awesome! into the workflow data. 8 end field defines that the current state is the end of the workflow. When the workflow reaches the end state, the workflow stops and the REST endpoint returns the workflow data, such as: Example workflow data { \"greeting\": \"Hello World\", \"mantra\": \"Serverless Workflow is awesome!\" } The workflow definition follows the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification. For more information, see CNCF Serverless Workflow Specification Support. After creating a workflow, you can run your Serverless Workflow application. Procedure Enter the following command to run your Serverless Workflow application: Quarkus CLI Maven Knative CLI Run your Serverless Workflow application using Quarkus CLI quarkus dev Run your Serverless Workflow application using Maven mvn clean quarkus:dev Deploys the project to authenticated cluster kn workflow deploy Follow this guide to know more information on Knative CLI.

For information about orchestrating and configuring the OpenAPI based services, you must see the following documents: Orchestrating OpenAPI based services Configuring OpenAPI services endpoints in different environments The OpenAPI support for Serverless Workflow is based on the Quarkus OpenAPI generator extension. For more information about Quarkus OpenAPI generator, see Quarkus - OpenAPI Generator. According to the OpenAPI specification, you can secure an OpenAPI service operation by using a security scheme. These security schemes are defined in the Security Scheme Object definitions of the OpenAPI specification file. The security scheme type defined for an OpenAPI service operation is used to identify the required configuration, when a Serverless Workflow invokes the same operation. The following shows the example of security scheme definitions: Example security-example.json file \"securitySchemes\": { \"http-basic-example\": { \"type\": \"http\", \"scheme\": \"basic\" } \"api-key-example\": { \"type\": \"apiKey\", \"name\": \"my-example-key\", \"in\": \"header\" } } If the OpenAPI specification file contains securitySchemes definitions, but not Security Requirement Object definitions, the generator can be configured to create the security requirement objects by default. In this case, for all operations without a security requirement, the default one is created. Note that the property value needs to match the name of a security scheme object definition, such as http-basic-example or api-key-example in the previous securitySchemes list. Description Property Key Example Create security for the referenced security scheme quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.default.security.scheme quarkus.openapi-generator.codegen.default.security.scheme=http-basic-example To configure the credentials that are used to access the secured OpenAPI service operations and related parameters, you must use the application properties that are related to the security schemes. To compose the configuration keys, use the following format: Format for configuration keys quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].[auth_property_name] The previous format includes the following parameters: filename is the sanitized name of the file containing the OpenAPI specification, such as security_example_json. security_scheme_name is the sanitized name of the security scheme object definition in the OpenAPI specification file, such as http_basic_example or api_key_example. auth_property_name is the name of the property to configure, such as username. This property depends on the defined security scheme type. To sanitize the previous parameters, you can follow the Environment Variables Mapping Rules from Microprofile Configuration. In the mapping rules, any non-alphabetic character is replaced by an underscore (_). The security schemes defined in an OpenAPI specification file are global to all the operations that are available in the same file. This means that the configurations set for a particular security scheme also apply to the other secured operations. You can use the alternatives defined in the Quarkus configuration reference guide to configure the required properties. A common usage is to define environment variables to set the authentication secrets. For a complete example, see Orchestrating third party services using OAuth2 authentication. The following example shows security-example.json file, defining a sayHelloBasic operation, which is secured using the http-basic-example security scheme and supported configurations: Example security-example.json file for HTTP authentication { \"openapi\": \"3.1.0\", \"info\": { \"title\": \"Http Basic Scheme Example\", \"version\": \"1.0\" }, \"paths\": { \"/hello-with-http-basic\": { \"get\": { \"operationId\": \"sayHelloBasic\", \"responses\": { \"200\": { \"description\": \"OK\", \"content\": { \"text/plain\": { \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } } }, \"security\": [{\"http-basic-example\" : []}] } } }, \"components\": { \"securitySchemes\": { \"http-basic-example\": { \"type\": \"http\", \"scheme\": \"basic\" } } } } The following table shows the supported configurations that are used to secure the sayHelloBasic operation in the previous example: Table 1. Supported configuration examples for HTTP authentication Description Property key Example Username credentials quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].username quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.http_basic_example.username=MY_USER Password credentials quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].password quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.http_basic_example.password=MY_PASSWD The following example shows security-example.json file, defining a sayHelloBearer operation, which is secured using the http-bearer-example security scheme and supported configurations: Example security-example.json file for Bearer Token authentication { \"openapi\": \"3.1.0\", \"info\": { \"title\": \"Http Bearer Scheme Example\", \"version\": \"1.0\" }, \"paths\": { \"/hello-with-http-bearer\": { \"get\": { \"operationId\": \"sayHelloBearer\", \"responses\": { \"200\": { \"description\": \"OK\", \"content\": { \"text/plain\": { \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } } }, \"security\": [{\"http-bearer-example\" : []}] } } }, \"components\": { \"securitySchemes\": { \"http-bearer-example\": { \"type\": \"http\", \"scheme\": \"bearer\" } } } } The following table shows the supported configurations that are used to secure the sayHelloBearer operation in the previous example: Table 2. Supported configuration examples for Bearer Token authentication Description Property key Example Bearer Token quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].bearer-token quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.http_bearer_example.bearer-token=MY_TOKEN The following example shows security-example.json file, defining a sayHelloApiKey operation, which is secured using the api-key-example security scheme and supported configurations: Example security-example.json file for API key authentication { \"openapi\": \"3.1.0\", \"info\": { \"title\": \"Api Key Scheme Example\", \"version\": \"1.0\" }, \"paths\": { \"/hello-with-api-key\": { \"get\": { \"operationId\": \"sayHelloApiKey\", \"responses\": { \"200\": { \"description\": \"OK\", \"content\": { \"text/plain\": { \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } } }, \"security\": [{\"api-key-example\" : []}] } } }, \"components\": { \"securitySchemes\": { \"api-key-example\": { \"type\": \"apiKey\", \"name\": \"api-key-name\", \"in\": \"header\" } } } } The following table shows the supported configurations that are used to secure the sayHelloApiKey operation in the previous example: Table 3. Supported configuration examples for API key authentication Description Property key Example API Key quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].api-key quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.api_key_example.api-key=MY_KEY The API key scheme type contains an additional name property that configures the key name to use when the Open API service is invoked. Also, the format to pass the key depends on the value of the in property. When the value is header, the key is passed as an HTTP request parameter. When the value is cookie, the key is passed as an HTTP cookie. When the value is query, the key is passed as an HTTP query parameter. However, this is automatically managed without additional configurations. Following the previous example, the API key is passed as an http request parameter, such as api-key-name with the value MY_KEY. The following example shows security-example.json file, defining a sayHelloOauth2 operation, which is secured using the oauth-example security scheme and supported configurations: Example security-example.json file for OAuth2 authentication { \"openapi\": \"3.1.0\", \"info\": { \"title\": \"Oauth2 Scheme Example\", \"version\": \"1.0\" }, \"paths\": { \"/hello-with-oauth2\": { \"get\": { \"operationId\": \"sayHelloOauth2\", \"responses\": { \"200\": { \"description\": \"OK\", \"content\": { \"text/plain\": { \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } } }, \"security\": [{\"oauth-example\" : []}] } } }, \"components\": { \"securitySchemes\": { \"oauth-example\": { \"type\": \"oauth2\", \"flows\": { \"clientCredentials\": { \"authorizationUrl\": \"https://example.com/oauth\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://example.com/oauth/token\", \"scopes\": { } } } } } } } Unlike the http basic, http bearer, and apiKey security schemes, the Oauth2 authentication relies on the Quarkus OpenId Connect (OIDC) and Oauth2 Clients and Filters. Therefore, you must add Quarkus OIDC Client Filter Extension to your project as shown in the following example: Example of adding Quarkus OIDC client filter extension io.quarkus quarkus-oidc-client-filter You can also add the Quarkus OIDC client filter extension using the Quarkus CLI as shown in the following example: Add Quarkus OIDC client filter extension $ quarkus extension add quarkus-oidc-client-filter The token management operations are delegated to a Quarkus OidcClient using a simple naming convention. In the previous example, the token management operations that are used to access the sayHelloOauth2 operation are delegated to the OidcClient that is oauth_example. You can configure the OidcClient as shown in the following example: Example of configuring an OidcClient quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.auth-server-url=https://example.com/oauth quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.token-path=/tokens quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.discovery-enabled=false quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.client-id=kogito-app quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.grant.type=client quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.credentials.client-secret.method=basic quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example.credentials.client-secret.value=secret The suffix (quarkus.oidc-client.oauth_example) used in the previous configuration example is exclusive for the security scheme defined in the OpenAPI service specification file and the scheme name is sanitized using the mapping rules. You can use the authorization token propagation with OpenAPI operations that are secured using the oauth2 or http bearer security scheme type. When the configuration is set, you can propagate the authorization tokens that are passed to your Serverless Workflow during the workflow creation. The propagations must be configured individually for each security scheme, which enables you to configure the invocations that must propagate the token. Similar to other security scheme configurations, the token propagation applies to all the OpenAPI operations that are secured using the same security scheme. The following example shows security-example.json file, defining a sayHelloOauth2 operation, which is secured using the oauth-example security scheme and supported configurations: Example security-example.json file for authorization token propagation { \"openapi\": \"3.1.0\", \"info\": { \"title\": \"Oauth2 Scheme Example\", \"version\": \"1.0\" }, \"paths\": { \"/hello-with-oauth2\": { \"get\": { \"operationId\": \"sayHelloOauth2\", \"responses\": { \"200\": { \"description\": \"OK\", \"content\": { \"text/plain\": { \"schema\": { \"type\": \"string\" } } } } }, \"security\": [{\"oauth-example\" : []}] } } }, \"components\": { \"securitySchemes\": { \"oauth-example\": { \"type\": \"oauth2\", \"flows\": { \"clientCredentials\": { \"authorizationUrl\": \"https://example.com/oauth\", \"tokenUrl\": \"https://example.com/oauth/token\", \"scopes\": { } } } } } } } The following table shows the supported configurations that are used to secure the sayHelloOauth2 operation in the previous example: Table 4. Supported configuration examples for token propagation Property key Example quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].token-propagation=[true,false] quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.oauth_example.token-propagation=true Enables the token propagation for all the operations that are secured using the oauth-example scheme in the security-example.json file. By default, the standard HTTP authorization header is propagated. quarkus.openapi-generator.[filename].auth.[security_scheme_name].header-name=[http_header_name] quarkus.openapi-generator.security_example_json.auth.oauth_example.header-name=MyHeaderName States that the authorization token is read from the MyHeaderName header instead of the standard HTTP authorization header. The authorization tokens are propagated till the Serverless Workflow does not reach its waiting state. When the same Serverless Workflow is resumed, the tokens will not be propagated.

This guide describes how to create a workflow that invokes a running gRPC service and how to configure properties to locate that running gRPC service. For information about gRPC concepts, see gRPC. In order to illustrate how gRPC integration works, we are going to use an already existing Serverless Workflow application. This example greets a user in their preferred language by invoking a gRPC service. Relevant files of this Workflow Application are: gRPC proto file: This file defines a greeter service, which consists of the sayHello method. The sayHello method accepts two parameters, including name of the user and an optional language to use in the greeting message (English by default). The sayHello method returns the greeting message in the appropriate language. // The greeter service definition. service Greeter { // Sends a greeting rpc SayHello (HelloRequest) returns (HelloReply) {} } // The request message containing the user's name. message HelloRequest { string name = 1; string language=2; } // The response message containing the greetings message HelloReply { string message = 1; } Workflow definition file: This file defines an RPC function. \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"sayHello\", \"type\": \"rpc\", \"operation\": \"greeting.proto#Greeter#SayHello\" } ] In this rpc function, the operation property is composed of three tokens separated by #. The three tokens include: URI of the proto file (greeting.proto) Name of the service (Greeter) Name of the method (SayHello) Kogito supports three URI schemes, including http, file, and classpath (default). Therefore, in the previous example, the greeting.proto is expected to be found in the project classpath. The execution of the workflow consists of a single operation state, which is composed of one action. { \"name\": \"sayHello\", \"functionRef\" : { \"refName\": \"sayHello\", \"arguments\": { \"name\": \".name\", \"language\": \".language\" } } } In the previous example, the action invokes the sayHello RPC method using two model variables: name and language. These parameters are provided as part of the REST call that starts the workflow. Maven POM: The gRPC functionality is included within Serverless Workflow Quarkus extension, which means you do not need to add specific dependencies for gRPC to work with Serverless Workflow. This pom.xml file contains the following resource node: ${project.basedir}/../serverless-workflow-greeting-server-rpc-quarkus/src/main/proto greeting.proto The reason for this snippet to exist is to guarantee that the proto file is included in the classpath. Remember that in the Serverless Workflow file, the URI for the proto file does not contain any scheme, therefore the proto file is expected to be accessible in the classpath. The previous, Maven based, approach can be used when the source code of the Serverless Workflow and the gRPC server are stored in the same repository, but normally this will not be the case. If the proto file can be downloaded from a remote server, you might use the http scheme. If the proto file is not remotely accessible, you will need to manually obtain a copy of it and store in a directory that is included in the classpath (for example src/main/resources). Another possibility is to copy the proto file in a well known absolute path (that might a be a shared network file system) and use the file scheme. Application properties: In the application.properties file, you can add the information for the Serverless Workflow application to locate the gRPC server. Internally, the Serverless Workflow implementation uses the same set of properties as Quarkus gRPC client. The client-name used by Kogito is the service name declared in the proto file. So, since in our example we are calling a service called Greeter, we include the snippet below. quarkus.grpc.clients.Greeter.host=localhost quarkus.grpc.clients.Greeter.port=50051 In the same GitHub repository as the example application, there is a maven project which provides a simple implementation of the Greeter service. By default, this gRPC server runs on port 50051. Therefore, the same port is used in the application.properties file. Before running the Serverless Workflow application, you need to start the gRPC server the workflow invokes. To run the gRPC server, navigate to the serverless-workflow-greeting-server-rpc-quarkus directory in a commmand terminal and enter the command mvn compile exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=\"org.kie.kogito.examples.sw.greeting.GreeterService\" Now you need to run the Serverless Workflow application mvn clean quarkus:dev Once the Serverless Workflow application is started, you can invoke the workflow instance using any http client, such as curl curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' -d '{\"workflowdata\" : {\"name\": \"John\", \"language\": \"English\"}}' http://localhost:8080/jsongreet The answer should be similar to this one {\"id\":\"4376cc50-42d4-45ef-8a5e-6e403a654a30\",\"workflowdata\":{\"name\":\"John\",\"language\":\"English\",\"message\":\"Hello from gRPC service John\"}} You can also try greeting in a different language curl -X POST -H 'Content-Type:application/json' -H 'Accept:application/json' -d '{\"workflowdata\" : {\"name\": \"Javi\", \"language\": \"Spanish\"}}' http://localhost:8080/jsongreet In response, you will see the greeting in Spanish language.","title":"Orchestrating the gRPC based services","component":"serverlessworkflow","version":"main","name":"orchestration-of-grpc-services","url":"/serverlessworkflow/main/service-orchestration/orchestration-of-grpc-services.html","titles":[{"text":"Running the Serverless Workflow application","hash":"running-serverless-workflow-application","id":1}]},"32":{"id":32,"text":"This document describes how to call REST services using an OpenAPI specification file. Prerequisites The examples in this document assumes that you have following prerequisites: You have installed the Kogito tooling. For more information about the tooling, see Using Serverless Workflow tooling. You have created a Serverless Workflow project. For more information about creating a Serverless Workflow project, see Creating your first Serverless Workflow service. Kogito follows the CNCF Serverless Workflow specification function definition to send requests to remote REST services using an OpenAPI specification reference as shown in the following example: Example of an OpenAPI function definition { \"functions\":[ { \"name\":\"myFunction1\", \"operation\":\"classpath:/myopenapi-file.yaml#myFunction1\" } ] } In the previous example function definition, the type attribute can be ommited as the default value is rest. In the previous example, the operation attribute is a string, which is composed using the following parameters: URI that the engine uses to locate the specification file, such as classpath. Operation identifier. You can find the operation identifier in the OpenAPI specification file. Kogito supports the following URI schemes: classpath: This URI scheme is supported for the files that are located in the src/main/resources folder of the application project. The classpath is the default URI scheme. If you do not define a URI scheme as shown in the following examples, the file location is defined as src/main/resources/myopenapifile.yaml: classpath:/myopenapifile.yaml /myopenapifile.yaml file: This URI scheme is supported for the files that are located in the file system. http or https: This URI scheme is supported for remotely located files. The OpenAPI specification files must be available during the build time, because Kogito leverages the internal code generation feature to send requests on runtime. Therefore, once you have built the application image, Kogito will not have access to the files. For more information about building Serverless Workflow images, see Building Serverless Workflow Images using Quarkus CLI. To get started with orchestrating the OpenAPI based services, you must locate the REST services OpenAPI specification files. Usually, REST services expose their interface using the OpenAPI specification. For example, see the Petstore API. In case, the OpenAPI service that you want to add to the Serverless Workflow does not contain a specification file, you can either create a specification file or update the OpenAPI service to generate and expose the file. There are various REST frameworks that support the OpenAPI specification generation, including: Java Quarkus - Using OpenAPI and Swagger UI Spring Boot Documentation Go Go Swagger Documentation Python Flasgger .NET ASP.NET Core web API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI TypeScript Swagger UI Express PHP swagger-php If you do not have access to the REST service, which is used to add the OpenAPI specification generator, you can use Swagger Inspector. The Swagger Inspector generates the specification file based on HTTP traffic. To send REST requests that are based on the OpenAPI specification files, you need to perform the following procedures: Define the function references Access the defined functions in the Serverless Workflow states To send requests with the REST calls, first you need to define the OpenAPI functions. Prerequisites You have access to the OpenAPI specification files. Once you have access to the OpenAPI specification files, you can define the functions in the Serverless Workflow. You can also use the serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application as a reference. Procedure Copy the OpenAPI specification files of the service(s) you want to invoke into your Serverless Workflow service directory, which can be src/main/resources/specs. In the serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application, the services that are invoked include multiplication and subtraction services. The OpenAPI specification files in serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application are extracted from the running multiplication and subtraction services. The REST Quarkus applications expose the related OpenAPI specification files using the Quarkus Swagger extension. Following is an example OpenAPI specification of the multiplication REST service: Example multiplication REST service OpenAPI specification openapi: 3.0.3 info: title: Generated API version: \"1.0\" paths: /: post: operationId: doOperation (1) parameters: - in: header name: notUsed schema: type: string required: false requestBody: content: application/json: schema: $ref: '#/components/schemas/MultiplicationOperation' responses: \"200\": description: OK content: application/json: schema: type: object properties: product: format: float type: number components: schemas: MultiplicationOperation: (2) type: object properties: leftElement: format: float type: number rightElement: format: float type: number 1 operationId of the REST operation. The operationId in an OpenAPI specification is necessary to add a reference to the operation that you want to use in REST invocation. 2 Data structure of the REST operation. Use the same operationId to compose the final URI in the function definition as shown in the following example: OpenAPI functions definition in the Temperature Conversion example { \"functions\": [ { \"name\": \"multiplication\", \"operation\": \"specs/multiplication.yaml#doOperation\" (1) }, { \"name\": \"subtraction\", \"operation\": \"specs/subtraction.yaml#doOperation\" (2) } ] } 1 Function definition for OpenAPI multiplication function 2 Function definition for OpenAPI subtraction function After defining the function definitions, you can access the defined functions in the Serverless Workflow states. Prerequisites You have defined the OpenAPI functions in Serverless Workflow. For more information, see Defining OpenAPI functions in Serverless Workflow. Procedure Use a workflow action to call a function definition that you added. Any workflow action that consists of a similar approach of referencing the functions that you used in the function definition can call a defined function. To map the arguments of a function, you can refer to the parameters described in the Operation Object section of OpenAPI specification. Also, the engine maps the parameter naming according to the OpenAPI specification. After that, you can use jq expressions to extract the payload data and map the data to the required parameters. In the following example, the parameters are part of the request body: Example of mapping a function arguments { \"states\": [ { \"name\": \"SetConstants\", \"type\": \"inject\", \"data\": { \"subtractValue\": 32.0, \"multiplyValue\": 0.5556 }, \"transition\": \"Computation\" }, { \"name\": \"Computation\", \"actionMode\": \"sequential\", \"type\": \"operation\", (1) \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"subtract\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"subtraction\", (2) \"arguments\": { (3) \"leftElement\": \".fahrenheit\", \"rightElement\": \".subtractValue\" } } }, { \"name\": \"multiply\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"multiplication\", (4) \"arguments\": { (5) \"leftElement\": \".difference\", \"rightElement\": \".multiplyValue\" } } } ], \"end\": { \"terminate\": \"true\" } } ] } 1 Operation State definition 2 Reference to the subtraction function 3 Definition of the subtraction function arguments 4 Reference to the multiplication function 5 Definition of the multiplication function arguments In the serverless-workflow-temperature-conversion example application, the functions are called sequentially in an Operation State as shown in the previous example. For more information about mapping parameters in the request path instead of request body, you can refer to the following PetStore API example: Example Petstore OpenAPI specification excerpt { \"/pet/{petId}\": { \"get\": { \"tags\": [ \"pet\" ], \"summary\": \"Find pet by ID\", \"description\": \"Returns a single pet\", \"operationId\": \"getPetById\", \"parameters\": [ { \"name\": \"petId\", \"in\": \"path\", \"description\": \"ID of pet to return\", \"required\": true, \"schema\": { \"type\": \"integer\", \"format\": \"int64\" } } ] } } } Following is an example invocation of a function, in which only one parameter named petId is added in the request path: Example of calling the PetStore function { \"name\": \"CallPetStore\", (1) \"actionMode\": \"sequential\", \"type\": \"operation\", \"actions\": [ { \"name\": \"getPet\", \"functionRef\": { \"refName\": \"getPetById\", (2) \"arguments\": { (3) \"petId\": \".petId\" } } } ] } 1 State definition, such as CallPetStore. 2 Function definition reference. In the previous example, the function definition getPetById is for PetStore OpenAPI specification. 3 Arguments definition. In the previous example, Kogito adds the argument petId to the request path before sending a request. After accessing the function definitions in Serverless Workflow states, you can configure the endpoint URL of OpenAPI services. Kogito uses the Quarkus OpenAPI Generator extension and the Quarkus REST Client, and all the configurations are based on these components, which are backed using Quarkus Configuration. Prerequisites You have defined the function definitions in the Serverless Workflow. For more information, see Defining OpenAPI functions in Serverless Workflow. You have the access to the defined functions in the Serverless Workflow states. For more information, see Accessing functions in the Serverless Workflow states. Procedure To configure the endpoints, you must use the sanitized OpenAPI specification file name as the REST client configuration key. The configuration key must be set as a valid environment variable. For example, a file named as subtraction.yaml contains the configuration key as subtraction_yaml. For more information about how Kogito sanitizes file names, see Environment Variables Mapping Rules. You can use the same configuration key on each property that is related to the Quarkus REST client as shown in the following URL configuration example: Example of URL configuration quarkus.rest-client.subtraction_yaml.url=http://myserver.com To avoid hardcoding the URL in the application properties, you can use environment variables substitution, as shown in the following example: Example of URL configuration with environment variables quarkus.rest-client.subtraction_yaml.url=${SUBTRACTION_URL:http://myserver.com} In case the environment variable SUBTRACTION_URL is not found in the previous example, the URL redirects to http://myserver.com. You can also use environment variables to configure the application in Kubernetes environments, in which variables can be injected into the pod of the application. For more information about endpoints and general configuration, see Configuring OpenAPI services endpoints. In a future release, Kogito will provide support for Kubernetes Service Discovery feature. Using the Kubernetes Service Discovery feature, you can point to a Kubernetes or Knative object that you want to call. After that, the engine will automatically configure the endpoints once you deploy the endpoints in the cluster.

The testing procedure in this document is based on the serverless-workflow-examples/serverless-workflow-service-calls-quarkus example application. You can access this example application in the GitHub repository. The examples in this document assumes that you have the following prerequisites: You have installed the Kogito tooling. You have created a Serverless Workflow project that orchestrates OpenAPI services. WireMock is an open source Mocking API for unit, integration and performance tests. You can use it to isolate your tests from 3rd party APIs and prototype APIs that still don’t exist. The following procedure describes how to add WireMock to your Serverless Workflow application: Procedure Add the WireMock dependency to your pom.xml file. WireMock dependency com.github.tomakehurst wiremock-jre8 {wiremock.version} test Replace {wiremock.version} with the version of WireMock you want to use. Choose when you want to start your WireMock server. There are two options: Start WireMock server as a QuarkusTestResource. This means that your WireMock server will be started once before to run any test and will be stopped once the tests finishes. This is the option that fits most use cases. Start a WireMock server independently for each test. This is useful if you need different behavior for each test. Define how the WireMock server should be started. Starting a WireMock server example WireMockConfiguration config = WireMockConfiguration.wireMockConfig().dynamicPort(); (1) WireMockServer wireMockServer = new WireMockServer(config); (2) wireMockServer.start(); (3) 1 Creates the configuration for the WireMock server. It’s a good practice to use a dynamic port when possible. This way, you prevent the tests from failing due to port conflicts. When using a dynamic port is not possible, you can use the WireMockConfiguration#port(int) method to use a fixed port number. 2 Creates the WireMock server instance. 3 Starts the WireMock server. Mock the endpoints. Mocking endpoints example ObjectMapper objectMapper = new ObjectMapper(); JsonNode greecePayload = objectMapper.readTree(getClass().getResourceAsStream(\"/country_mock.json\")); (1) wireMockServer.stubFor(WireMock.get(WireMock.urlEqualTo(\"/rest/v2/name/Greece\")) (2) .willReturn(WireMock.aResponse() (3) .withStatus(200) (4) .withHeader(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\") (5) .withJsonBody(greecePayload))); (6) 1 Creates the JSON payload that will be returned by the WireMock server. Alternatively, you can use the ResponseDefinitionBuilder#withBody method to define a String or a byte[] as the response body. 2 Defines a stub for the /rest/v2/name/Greece endpoint. 3 Defines the response for the stub. 4 Defines the response status. 5 Defines the response headers. 6 Defines the response body. Stop the WireMock server. Stopping a WireMock server example wireMockServer.stop(); The following procedure describes how to start a WireMock server as a QuarkusTestResource. Procedure Create a class that implements the QuarkusTestResource interface.

Prerequisites Java at least version 11+ Maven at least version 3.8.1 Docker (Optional) Podman (Optional) Kubernetes CLI. You can download the latest binaries from the KIE Tooling Releases page. There are two ways to run kn workflow: You can run it standalone, just put it on your system path and make sure it is executable. You can install it as a plugin of the kn client to run: Follow the documentation to install kn CLI if you don’t have it. Copy the kn-workflow binary to a directory on your PATH (for example, /usr/local/bin) and make sure its filename is kn-workflow. On macOS give the ownership to the root user: sudo chown root: /usr/local/bin/kn-workflow Run kn plugin list to verify that the kn-workflow plugin is installed successfully. After installing the plugin, you can use kn workflow to run its related subcommands. After the installation, you will be able to use the workflow subcommand in the Knative CLI. It’s possible to use in two ways: kn workflow kn-workflow The following help message will appear after running the command above: Manage Kogito Serverless Workflow projects Usage: kn workflow [command] Available Commands: build Build a Kogito Serverless Workflow project and generate a container image completion Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell create Create a Kogito Serverless Workflow project deploy Deploy a Kogito Serverless Workflow project help Help about any command Flags: -h, --help help for kn-workflow -v, --verbose Print verbose logs Use \"kn workflow [command] --help\" for more information about a command. The create command scaffolds a new Kogito Serverless Workflow project in the current directory. It sets up a Quarkus project with minimal extensions to build a Kogito Serverless Workflow project. Also, the generated project has a \"hello world\" workflow.sw.json located on the .//src/main/resources directory. Creates a new project called \"new-project\" kn workflow create By default, the generated project is named \"new-project\". This name can be overwritten with the [-n|--name] flag. Creates a new project called \"my-project\" kn workflow create --name my-project Also, it’s possible to add more extensions to the Quarkus project during its creation by using the [-e|--extension] flag. You can pass more than one extension, but they need to be separated by a comma. Creates a new project with \"quarkus-jsonp\" and \"quarkus-smallrye-openapi\" extensions kn workflow create --extension quarkus-jsonp,quarkus-smallrye-openapi The first time you use the create command, it can take a while due to the necessity to download all dependencies for the Quarkus project. The build command builds a Kogito Serverless Workflow project in the current directory and generates a container image. The build process produces a knative.yml deploy file in the ./target/kubernetes folder. If your workflow has events, it’ll also generate a kogito.yml deploy file. To use the the build you need to provide at least one of the two flags: --image or --image-name. Builds the project and generates a local image called \"quay.io/my-project\" kn workflow build --image my-project kn workflow build --image-name my-project The \"registry\" and \"tag\" defaults are \"quay.io\" and \"latest\" respectively. Let’s take a better look at the image naming options. The [-i|--image] flag can be used in several ways. --image=[name] --image=[name]:[tag] --image=[repository]/[name] --image=[repository]/[name]:[tag] --image=[registry]/[repository]/[name] --image=[registry]/[repository]/[name]:[tag] Also, it’s possible to use specific flags to compose the image’s full name. --image-registry --image-repository --image-name --image-tag If the \"--image\" flag is provided together with any of these flags, the specific value will override \"--image\". Builds the project and generates a local image called \"quay.io/other-user/my-project:1.0.1\" kn workflow build --image my-user/my-project:1.0.0 --image-repository other-user --image-tag 1.0.1 We have two different strategies to build the project and generate the image. Jib Jib is an extension that enables building a container image without the necessity of a container runtime. Rebuilds are fast, and the resultant image is optimized. Builds the project and generates a local image using Jib (Save it in the Docker runtime) kn workflow build --image my-project --jib Builds the project and generates a local image using Jib (Save it in the Podman runtime) kn workflow build --image my-project --jib-podman If you don’t want to use any container runtime, use the --push option, so the built image will be immediately pushed to the respective registry. Builds the project and pushes the image using Jib (No container runtime required) kn workflow build --image my-project --jib --push Remember to have access to your registry before using the \"--push\" option. You can do it using the \"docker login\", \"podman login\", or any other equivalent method. Docker Building with Docker is straightforward as it’s the default option. Also, it’s possible to automatically push the image to the respective registry by using the --push option. Builds the project and pushes the image using Docker kn workflow build --image my-project --push The deploy command deploys a Kogito Serverless Workflow project in the current directory (build command is required). It uses the ./target/kubernetes folder to find the generated knative.yml and, if exists, the kogito.yml. If your deployment files are saved in another folder, it’s possible to override the path with the --path flag. Also, remember to have access to your cluster, and your cluster needs to have access to your image. Deploys the project to authenticated cluster kn workflow deploy kn workflow deploy --path other-path If you need to use a more complex deploy setup, we recommend directly using the \"kubectl\" command line. If you want to build the project from source, follow the steps: git clone git@github.com:kie-group/kie-tools.git cd kie-tools pnpm bootstrap pnpm -F @kie-tools/kn-plugin-workflow... build:dev cd packages/kn-plugin-workflow go mod tidy If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.

For more information about installing the VS Code extension, see Installing the VS Code Extension for Serverless Workflow editor. Procedure Open your Serverless Workflow file in VS Code IDE and select the Setup Service Registries option. Navigate to the settings.json file. Add the list of service registries in the settings.json file using the kogito.swf.serviceRegistries key, which matches the following JSON schema: Service Registry Schema { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"registries\": { \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": { \"type\": \"object\", \"properties\": { \"name\": { \"type\": \"string\" }, (1) \"url\": { (2) \"type\": \"string\", \"format\": \"uri\", \"pattern\": \"^https?://?[-A-Za-z0-9+&@#/%?=_!:.]+[-A-Za-z0-9+&@#/%=~_|]\" }, \"authProvider\": { (3) \"type\": \"string\", \"enum\": [\"none\", \"red-hat-account\"], \"default\": \"none\" } }, \"required\": [\"name\", \"url\", \"authProvider\"] } } } } In the registries array, each item must contain the following properties: 1 name: Identifier provided for a registry. 2 url: URL for the REST API of the remotes service registry, such as Apicurio registry. 3 authProvider: Type of authentication for the remote service registry. This property contains values as none (no authentication) and red-hat-account (log in with your Red Hat account). Following is an example of a service registry configuration: Example of service registry configuration { \"kogito.swf.serviceRegistries\": { \"registries\": [ { \"name\": \"openshift\", \"url\": \"https://{url-to-openshift-registry}/apis/registry/v2\", \"authProvider\": \"red-hat-account\" }, { \"name\": \"local\", \"url\": \"https://{url-to-local-registry}/apis/registry/v2\", \"authProvider\": \"none\" }, ] } } To access the service registry settings in the VS Code, click on the Setup Service Registries option and use the Serverless Workflow: Configure Service Registries command. You can use the service registries for auto-completion feature in the Serverless Workflow VS Cod extension. Prerequisites The following prerequisites are for the service registries that require Red Hat authentication: You have a Red Hat account with access to Red Hat Hybrid Cloud Console. Red Hat authentication extension is installed. Procedure In a Serverless Workflow file, click the Setup Service Registries options and navigate to the settings.json file to configure the service registries. Figure 9. Function definition section with Setup Service Registries option Once you configure the service registry settings, the function definition section in Serverless Workflow file displays a Log in Service Registries button. The Log in Service Registries button appears when the function definition is configured to a remote service registry, such as Apicurio registry. Click on the Log in Service Registries option. You are redirected to the Red Hat login (SSO) page. Log in with your Red Hat credentials to connect to the remote service registry. You are redirected to the Red Hat login (SSO) page only if the authProvider property contains the value of red-hat-account in the service registry settings. Figure 10. Function definition section with Log in Service Registries option After logging in, use Ctrl+Space in the function definition section to view the list of available functions. Figure 11. Example of function definition section auto-complete dialog box Click on a function to auto-complete the function definition as shown in the following example: Figure 12. Example of an auto-completed function definition After selecting an option in the auto-complete dialog box, the OpenAPI specification file is downloaded into the specs folder. The downloaded OpenAPI specification file follows the REGISTRY-NAME_OPERATION-NAME_VERSION format. Figure 13. Downloaded OpenAPI specification file To fetch the new changes in the service registry, click Refresh Service Registries. Figure 14. Refresh Service Registries button in function definition section To create a new function definition object, click Add function. You can also validate the auto-completion using the JSON schema to the workflow file structure. The Serverless Workflow editor performs validation using JSON schema to the workflow file structure but not the values, and auto-completion works with JSON but not with YAML. To view the validation warnings and errors, go to View → Problems or press Ctrl+Shift+M to open the Problems tab. Figure 15. Errors and warnings in Problems tab If you find an issue or any misleading information, please feel free to report it here.
